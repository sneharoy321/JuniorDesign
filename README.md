# About the Game
Community on Demand is a card game designed to help people understand their skillsets and the skills they need to get in order to develop their careers. Our project is to implement an app version of this game with additional features such as resume building assistance and a skills report.

# Basic Artifact
Our artifact was constructed using JavaFX. JavaFX is a great tool for implementing Graphical User Interfaces and organizing the structure of applications. We used JavaFX to construct a demo of our mobile application in order to understand our current technical abilities and to attempt transforming parts of our figma prototype into acual Java code.

# How to Run
To run our artifact, please install version 11 JavaFX sdk: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/.

Please also install Java 11: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.

If you are unsure of whether Java 11 is installed on your computer, use this command in your terminal: java -version.

To compile our program, you can use this command in the terminal: javac --module-path javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls Controller.java.

To run, you can use this command: java --module-path javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls Controller.

Replace javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib with the path to your javafx-sdk-11.0.2 lib folder.
